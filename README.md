* [ReactJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Next] - fast node.js network app framework
* [Solidity] - a contract-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts
* [Ethereum] - an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract functionality
* [Rinkby Testnet] - a clone of the Ethereum network that allows to deploy and test smart contracts
